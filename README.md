# CNN MALDI-TOF Antimicrobial Prediction
## Code
This contains code created for the work on my masters thesis, with the following title:

**Using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to predict antibiotic resistance from mass spectra**

It is usable as a reference, for the thesis itself.
Dependencies are not included and code can not be run as is.
